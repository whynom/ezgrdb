# GRDB the _EZ_ way

GRDB felt pretty overwhelming when I was first confronted with it, but it also looked very promising.  After _barely_ squeezing the basics out of `Core Data` and `Swift Data` I realized that while they had an easy learning curve, whenever a problem arose it was a big hassle to fix because I didn't know what was going on.

My hopes are that GRDB might be a little more difficult to learn, but in the end, because I understand what is going on, it will be a lot more flexible and fixable.  This repo is an attempt to get a basic understanding of what is going on to get a pretty simple database up and running with some explanation.

## An app from ground up, step by step
The motivation for making this app is to build a very simple app similar to the one in the GRDB repo, but step by step to hopefully show what everything is doing.  Hopefully, I, or anyone else, will be able to follow along with this whenever they are setting up a new app and need to get a good GRDB backed persistence model going.

### Making a functioning test file 
Add the following imports to your test file

``` swift
import Testing
import GRDB
import Foundation
@testable import EZ_GRDB
```

You'll be immediately be addressed with a very sensible error saying you don't have the GRDB package installed because you don't!  Let's add it now.

The dependency can be added to the project in XCode by going to

`File -> Add package dependency`

Enter the github url for the package in the search bar and install https://github.com/groue/GRDB.swift

While that adds the package to your project, it's still not added to your testing target.  Go into the app project and add it under `Frameworks and Libraries` for your testing target.

Your error is now gone and we can start writing tests.

#### A test for tasks
I want to show how to save data with a string, a date and a number, so I'm choosing to make a _project_.  Hopefully, we'll be able to attach tasks to that project to show to connect two tables together eventually.

Let's get our first test that inserts a `Project` into our database.

``` swift
struct EZ_GRDBTests {

    @Test func insert() throws {
        // Given an empty database
        let appDatabase = try makeEmptyTestDatabase()
        
        // When we insert a project
        var insertedProject = Project(name: "Build a house", dueDate: Date(), priority: 1000)
        try appDatabase.saveProject(&insertedProject)
        
        // Then the inserted project has an id
        #expect(insertedProject.id != nil)
        
        // Then the inserted project exists in the database
        let fetchedProject = try appDatabase.reader.read(Project.fetchOne)
        #expect(fetchedProject == insertedProject)
    }

    /// Return an empty, in-memory, `AppDatabase`.
    private func makeEmptyTestDatabase() throws -> AppDatabase {
        let dbQueue = try DatabaseQueue(configuration: AppDatabase.makeConfiguration())
        return try AppDatabase(dbQueue)
    }

}
```

This gives some errors having to do with the fact that
1. We don't have a `Project` model.
2. We don't have a a database and its corresponding methods to make a configuration.

Let's deal with the `Project` model first.

##### Project model
Within our top app directory add a directory called `Database`. Within that folder make another folder called `Models`.  Finally, within that `Models` add a swift file called `Project`.  Add the following to that file.

``` swift
import Foundation

struct Project: Equatable {
    var id: Int64?
    var name: String
    var dueDate: Date
    var priority: Int
}
```

A simple straightforward model to use to make and use `Project`s, and we've taken care of one of the problems with our test.

- [ ] Explain why `Equatable`.
- [ ] Explain why the id is an optional.

##### AppDatabase
Now more to the point, we're going to start defining the actual database.  The two spots we're failing in our test is in the _making_ of the database and the _reading_ of the database.  Let's see if we can't fix those problems.

Let's add a new swift file to the `Database` folder called `AppDatabase` and within that file add the following code.

``` swift
import Foundation
import GRDB
import os.log

final class AppDatabase: Sendable {
    private let dbWriter: any DatabaseWriter
    
    init(_ dbWriter: any GRDB.DatabaseWriter) throws {
        self.dbWriter = dbWriter
        try migrator.migrate(dbWriter)
    }
    
}
```

Just adding those imports, you'll run into an error about importing the `GRDB` library.  Remember to add the framework to your actual app target the same way you did for your app tests.

Here we're initializing our database with a `dbWriter` so we can start a `migrator`, but we have an error involving that `migrator` because we need to define it.  Define it with the following code to be inserted within the `AppDatabase` scope.

``` swift
...
    private var migrator: DatabaseMigrator {
        var migrator = DatabaseMigrator()
        
#if DEBUG
        migrator.eraseDatabaseOnSchemaChange = true
#endif
        
        migrator.registerMigration("v1") { db in
            try db.create(table: "project") { t in
                t.autoIncrementedPrimaryKey("id")
                t.column("name", .text).notNull()
                t.column("dueDate", .text).notNull()
                t.column("priority", .integer).notNull()
            }
        }
        
        return migrator
    }
...
```

When we initiate `migrator` we start a version of the database with the player table.  We can later add more versions of this table or even add new tables to our database later to update our app as we update it's capabilites.

For more information on what we're doing, check out the following in the GRDB documentation.

1. [databse connections](https://swiftpackageindex.com/groue/GRDB.swift/documentation/grdb/databaseconnections)

2. [migrations](https://swiftpackageindex.com/groue/GRDB.swift/documentation/grdb/migrations)

3. [Erase database on schema](https://swiftpackageindex.com/groue/GRDB.swift/documentation/grdb/migrations#The-eraseDatabaseOnSchemaChange-Option)

4. [database schema](https://swiftpackageindex.com/groue/GRDB.swift/documentation/grdb/databaseschema)


- [ ] What is the method `migrate` that depends on a `dbWriter`?
- [ ] Is the `registerMigration` method making a new database if a previous one doesn't exist?

##### Update the `Project` model.
We need our Project model to get some functionality from certain protocols.

1. Reader
Add the following in a new extension below our original `AppDatabase` definition.

``` swift
extension AppDatabase {
    var reader: any GRDB.DatabaseReader {
        dbWriter
    }
}
```

Thankfully, we get no errors with this code.

2. Save

Let's put this in an `AppDatbase` extension _between_ our `AppDatabase` definition and the extension we just wrote above.  I'm only following this convention as that's how it's done in the [GRDB Demo App](https://github.com/groue/GRDB.swift/tree/master/Documentation/DemoApps/GRDBDemo) which I'm following pretty closely here.

``` swift
extension AppDatabase {
    func saveProject(_ project: inout Project) throws {
        try dbWriter.write { db in
            try project.save(db)
        }
    }
    
}
```

This does give us a new error!  We have no method `save` for our `Project` type.  We'll add a the `MutablePersistableRecord` to give us this saving function as well as `Codable` and `FetchableRecord`.  A the same time we'll define the columns and `didInsert` method.  Put the following code an extension below the original `Project` definition in the `Project` file we created earlier.

``` swift
extension Project: Codable, FetchableRecord, MutablePersistableRecord {
    enum Columns {
        static let name = Column(CodingKeys.name)
        static let dueDate = Column(CodingKeys.dueDate)
        static let priority = Column(CodingKeys.priority)
    }
}
```

- [ ] What do the Codable and FetchableRecord protocols(?) do?  Are they both protocols?

3. Making a configuration
Add this in another extension on `AppDatabase` we'll put above our extension that defined the `reader` variable.

``` swift
extension AppDatabase {
    static func makeConfiguration(_ config: Configuration = Configuration()) -> Configuration {
        
        return config
    }
}
```

- [ ] This fails the basic test with the following error
`Expectation failed: (insertedProject.id â†’ nil) != nil
// Then the inserted project has an id`.
